# weather-app
The Weather App project from The Odin Project.

Live: https://luuu-xu.github.io/weather-app/

This project is fairly easy once the Promise/then or async/await mechanisim is understood.

- Possible feature to add:
  - waiting icon
  - search suggestions via geoAPI
  - background colours changing with weather condition?
